Notch signaling pathway	58	Notch signaling promotes proliferative signaling during neurogenesis, and its activity is inhibited by Numb to promote neural differentiation. It plays a major role in the regulation of embryonic development. 
Regulation of nuclear SMAD2/3 signaling	54	SMAD proteins play a role in cell cycle control. Possible role of SMAD in alzheimer’s.
AndrogenReceptor	52	Androgen-regulated genes are critical for the development and maintenance of the male sexual phenotype. 
C-MYB transcription factor network	52	Cell cycle regulation. Oncogene.
Glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network	52	glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones.regulates genes controlling the development, metabolism, and immune response. They are important in arousal and cognition.Glucocorticoids act on the hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal lobes. 
Activation of anterior HOX genes in hindbrain development during early embryogenesis	51	HOX genes specify regions of the body plan along the head-tail axis.Essential for the establishment of regionalized neuronal identity. 
Regulation of Androgen receptor activity	51	Androgen-regulated genes are critical for the development and maintenance of the male sexual phenotype. 
Pyrimidine metabolism	50	critical pathway that generates purine and pyrimidine molecules for DNA replication, RNA synthesis, and cellular bioenergetics
AP-1 transcription factor network	45	AP-1 controls a number of cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.
p53 pathway	45	p53 “the guardian of the genome” tumor suppressor. Apoptosis regulation.
