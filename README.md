# **Scripts**

This is a repository for all the scripts that where developed during my internship

## Contents: 
- run-crup.sh: This script runs the CRUP software through all of the samples of a certain type run and type of sample. Type run and type sample are pased via arguments.\ 
For example:\ 
`bash run-crup.sh Primary_cells Single_ended`



- filehandling.sh: This script prepares the data for running CRUP. It performs merges and indexes the files. Type run, type sample and sample name are passed via arguments.\
For example:\
`bash filehandling.sh Single_ended Cell_lines HCT116`

*The arguments passed to all scripts have to be written exactly the same as in the folders containing the data*
